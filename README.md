# Computer-Vision-and-Image-processing
Project for Computer Vision and Image processing Exam 2017 (UBB Cluj Napoca - Department of Computer Science)

## Dependencies

This project uses Python 3. To install all dependencies use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use it

Extract the dataset file `coil-20-proc.zip` and then use the converter script:

```bash
python convert_dataset.py
```

Create the model with the following command (this may require some time, depends on your computer computational resources):

```bash
python coil_conv.py
```

Open the program and drag an image of the dataset to see the model at work:

```bash
python program.py
```
